Credit Score Project

This repository contains a complete pipeline for Credit Score analysis, prediction, and deployment using a Telegram bot.

Project Overview:

The project consists of three main components:

1) Credit Score Analysis

   Preprocessing and visualizing credit score data.

   Selecting the most significant features that impact the credit score.

3) Credit Score Prediction

   Implementing a predictive model using the RandomForestClassifier.

   Training and evaluating the model for accurate credit score predictions.

5) Deployment

   Deploying the trained model into a Telegram bot for user interaction.

Technologies Used:

   Python
  
   Pandas, NumPy (for data preprocessing)
  
   Matplotlib, Seaborn (for visualization)
  
   Scikit-learn (for machine learning model)
  
   Telegram API (for deployment)

Future Enhancements:

  Improve model accuracy by testing other machine learning algorithms.
 
  Integrate more user-friendly interactions within the Telegram bot.
 
  Expand deployment to a web-based interface.
